## Description
Like Blueimp's jQuery plugin (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) but wish that it was written around a nice framework like backbone.marionette? Me too. This is my attempt to make the world of free web-based file uploaders a little better. Enjoy! 

## Development Plan
Right now my goal is simply to create a dry-running version of the file-uploader, then once that is working to my satisfaction I'll make it actually interact with the server using Blueimp's method.

## Usage
Simply download and open index.html in your favorite browser
